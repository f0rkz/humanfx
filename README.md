# HumanFX

A library/example program to control the keyboard backlight driver present on Dell's G15 5515. This will not work (out-of-the-box) on any other laptop.

The files `humanfx.c` and `humanfx.h` contain the actual driver code, while `main.c` stands in mostly as an example of how you can use it to provide a command-line interface. It also contains many functions that showcases some keyboard effects you can program using this utility.
